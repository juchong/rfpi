# Core Guardrails & Workflow Rules

- Make sure your replies are concise and complete. 
- Do not ramble or celebrate. 
- Always back up your answers with search results to ensure you have the latest data/settings/best practices. 
- If you are unsure, try searching for answers online and discussing what you’re thinking with the user. 
- Read the rules, if available and always refer to them when presenting your plan for my approval. 
- Always present a plan to the user. 
- Never do anything without gaining agreement with the user (the user approving the plan). 
- Keep responses **short and focused**.
- **Never commit code automatically**; only commit when explicitly requested.
- **Never create files automatically** (README, summaries, logs, etc.) unless the user asks.
- The agent **does not have access to `.env` files** and must not assume their contents.
- Always confirm the remote host with `hostname -f` and `whoami` before major changes.
- Propose a clear plan and await user confirmation before executing.
- Prefer dry-runs and validation (`docker compose config`, `nginx -t`, etc.) before any change.
- Never delete Docker volumes, networks, or persistent data without explicit user approval and a rollback path.
- Provide optional post-check suggestions only when relevant (logs, healthchecks, port tests).
- Always follow 002-Git-Rules.mdc when interacting with Git
