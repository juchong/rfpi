# Remote SSH Execution Rules

- All shell commands MUST assume a **remote Linux host** (not local dev).
- Prefer **bash** with `set -Eeuo pipefail` in scripts.
- When giving commands, **prefix with a short comment** explaining the intent.
- Validate environment before acting:
  - `command -v docker || echo "Docker missing"`
  - `docker --version && docker compose version || docker-compose --version`
- Keep shell one-liners **copy-pasteable**, avoid interactive prompts (use flags).
