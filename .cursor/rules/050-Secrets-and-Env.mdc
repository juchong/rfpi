# Secrets & Env

- Never commit secrets. Use:
  - Compose `secrets:` with external files / Docker secrets, or an external secrets manager.
  - `.env` only for non-sensitive defaults; prefer per-host overrides kept outside VCS.
- Before running any command that might echo secrets, **redact values** in the plan/output.
- Provide a **.env.example** with placeholders and documentation.
