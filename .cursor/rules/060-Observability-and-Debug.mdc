# Observability & Debug

- Quick status: `docker compose ps`, `docker ps --no-trunc`.
- Logs:
  - `docker compose logs --since=10m <svc>` for targeted troubleshooting.
  - Suggest log rotation if files grow quickly.
- Health:
  - Prefer explicit container `HEALTHCHECK`; surface failures in post-checks.
- Connectivity:
  - Validate exposed ports with `ss -tulpen | grep -E ':(80|443|<custom>)'` and `curl -I https://host`.
- For 502/504 proxy errors: check upstream container health + proxy upstream config.
