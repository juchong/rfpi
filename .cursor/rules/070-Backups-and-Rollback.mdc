# Backups & Rollback

- File edits: save timestamped backups before changes.
- Compose:
  - **Do not remove volumes** without an explicit, written backup plan.
  - If migrating images or tags, record old → new tag map.
- Rollback recipe must be included in every plan:
  - Commands to revert files from backups.
  - `docker compose up -d` with prior image tags if needed.
- After rollback, run the same post-checks to confirm restoration.
